            <h3>Remembering Steve Jobs</h3>
            <p>
                Dear Steve, As much as I was a strong believer in using Windows everywhere for any reason, I have to admit, I have been converted. I own a MacBook and I absolutely love it. I've owned several iPods, and now, I am very glad to own an iPhone 4. Personally, I think the iPhone 4 is the most innovative technology out. The way it feels in your hand, the slimness, all the way down to how rugged it is, yet classy. Your inspiration will be missed, and that sincere smile you have when sharing your creation with the world will be remembered. I always looked forward to the Keynote presentations you would lead and the new and amazing technology that was presented in the show. Thank you for your innovation and your amazing mind. No matter what people told you, you always seemed to say to them "It can be done."

                I just wanted to say that Steve jobs inspired me to want to become an Apple employee. It is my dream/ goal to work at Apple.

            <h3>What Steve Jobs meant to me</h3>
            <p>
                This is equivalent to my mom's generation of Elvis dying for me. I am very sadden and emotionally moved at the moment. He was more influential on my life than my parents and friends. While my parents loved me and friends shared fun times. Steve influenced me, motivated me to become the innovated, creative technologist I have become. I got into computer technology in 1980 and moved to Silicon Valley because of him. I have been one of his biggest admirers and looked to him as a mentor to push the boundaries of my own creative abilities to develop technology solutions which I hope made a difference and impact to the industries I worked in. We've lost a significant influence and icon in technology. We won't see another person of his innovation and foresight within my life time. He was the Edison of technology. He was and is one of my biggest inspirations. I feel I have lost a close family member

                Steve. Good bye, no one will fit your shoes. When another genius like you appears in this world, I know will be god, you are god you are forever, do not forget your computer, you will need it to keep innovating, heaven will bless you, you bless me, windows will freeze my pc and you will not be here to help me, bless me on my ciber future.
